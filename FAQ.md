### What if I don't know Perl?
If you don't know Perl, that's OK! Several <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo/Readme.md#overview">plugin types</a> are not in Perl. Also, if you know PHP, Ruby, or Python you should be able to write Goodies in Perl pretty easily using [this awesome cheat sheet](http://hyperpolyglot.org/scripting).

### Do you have any plugin ideas?
Yup! We maintain [a growing list](http://ideas.duckduckhack.com/). There are also improvement ideas for [Goodies](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/issues), [Spice](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice/issues), [Fathead](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead/issues) and [Longtail](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-longtail/issues).

### How do I note that I've started on something?
In your initial pull request, please note the link on the [idea list](http://ideas.duckduckhack.com/). We'll move it to the "in process" bucket for you.

### Where I can report plugin bugs?
Submit GitHub issues in the [appropriate repo](http://github.com/duckduckgo).

### What if there are plugin conflicts?
The ultimate arbiter is the user, and that's the perspective we take. In other words, we ask "what is best for the user experience?" That said, it often makes sense to combine ideas into one, better plugin.

### Can I do something more complicated?
Maybe. There are a bunch more internal interfaces we haven't exposed yet, and we'd love to hear your ideas to influence that roadmap.

### What's the roadmap?
Here's what we're working on (in roughly in this order):

* better testing/file structure for spice plugins.
* better JS interface for spice plugin callback functions.
* better attribution.
* embedding plugins.
* better testing/file structure for fathead plugins.
* more defined structure for longtail plugins.
* better testing for longtail plugins.
