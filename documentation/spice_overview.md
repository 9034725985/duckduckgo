# Spice Overview
[Index](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo/) / **Spice Overview**

---
Spice plugins are triggered by a backend Perl component that then calls the JSON API of an upstream service. The API response is wrapped in a JavaScript function call. You, the plugin author, define this callback function and handle the API's response on the client side.

Follow this list to go through the spice progression and learn to write a spice plugin.

1. **[Basic Tutorial](general.md#basic-tutorial)** -- this will show you the fundamentals of making a plugin. It's a simple walkthrough-by-example and gives a good introduction to the system.
2. **[Spice Handle Functions](spice.md#spice-handle-functions)** -- this section provides an overview of the different variables that a spice plugin can process.
3. **[Testing Triggers](testing.md#testing-triggers)** -- this will lead you through how to use duckpan, our command-line utility, to test the plugins that you've written and make sure your triggers are working properly.
4. **[Spice Callback Functions](spice.md#spice-callback-functions)** -- this section explains how JavaScript callback functions are generated by the plugin system.
5. **[Testing Spice](testing.md#testing-spice)** -- this section introduces you to the spice testing process.
6. **[Submitting Plugins](general.md#submitting-plugins)** -- this section guides you through the plugin submission process, and is the last section that you need to gain a basic understanding of the entire process.
7. Once you're familiar with the above sections, it's time to move on the [Spice repository](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice#advanced-spice), which contains an advanced section with information about more involved spice creation, and the [Advanced](advanced.md) plugin-agnostic docs.
