Goodies are Perl-only plugins that can essentially be contained within one Perl function. They are evaluated on our servers and include no external calls to other services.

Follow this list to go through the goodie progression and learn how to write one.

1. **[Basic Tutorial](general.md#basic-tutorial)** -- this will show you the fundamentals of making a plugin. It's a simple walkthrough-by-example and gives a good introduction to the system.
2. **[Testing Triggers](testing.md#testing-triggers)** -- this will lead you through how to use duckpan, our command-line utility, to test the plugins that you've written and make sure your triggers are working properly.
3. **[Submitting Plugins](general.md#submitting-plugins)** -- this section guides you through the plugin submission process, and is the last section that you need to gain a basic understanding of the entire process.
4. Once you're familiar with the above three sections, it's time to move on the [Goodies repository](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies), which contains information about advanced goodie creation, and the [Advanced](advanced.md) plugin-agnostic docs.
